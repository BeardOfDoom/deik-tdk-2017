# Home page
title.home = Home
home.welcome = Welcome!
home.desc.header.general = General
home.desc.p.general = This web application was made for the University of Debrecen Faculty of Informatics. The aim of the project is to help students learning the basics of artificial intelligence course. With a unique modelling language you can describe your own problem, and we convert it to a Java file. You can run predefined search algorithms on it, or you can upload your own. Finally you can view the traversed state-space graph, and get some useful information about it.
home.desc.header.reglog = Registration and login
home.desc.p.reglog = To use the main functionality of the page, you must first register an account. After registration, you will be automatically logged in, but you can do it yourself later, too, in the login page.
home.desc.header.profile = Profile page
home.desc.p.profile = After logging in, the Profile page will be available for you. In this page, you can view the list of your problems and search algorithms. Clicking on the links, you can check the result of the search algorithms. Every search algorithm can be in 3 different states: done, in progress and error.
home.desc.header.problem = New problem
home.desc.p.problem = In the New problem page you can define a new problem, and you can run different search algorithms on it. You have to fill some required fields there. You can define your new problem, or you can choose one of the demo problems. You can find the full specification of the problem defining language in the following <a href="https://github.com/veresdavid/deik-tdk-2017/tree/master/generator">link</a>. We have 9 different predefined search algorithms, but you can also upload your own. After submitting, if no error occurs, the result links will appear.
home.desc.header.graph = Graph visualizer
home.desc.p.graph = In the result links you can view the graphs traversed by a search algorithm. We can replay the progress of the search algorithm by using the correct buttons. Under the graph, we can see some useful information about the search, and we can also download all the generated files.
home.desc.header.github = GitHub
home.desc.p.github = All the project files are available in the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/veresdavid/deik-tdk-2017">https://github.com/veresdavid/deik-tdk-2017</a>. Here you can find a detailed description about how to start the application on any computer.
home.desc.header.lang = Language
home.desc.p.lang = The page is currently available in two different languages: hungarian and english. You can change it by clicking on the flag icons in the right section of the header.
